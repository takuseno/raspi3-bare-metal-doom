# Bare Metal Doom for Raspberry Pi 3

This project is aiming to run Doom on Raspberry Pi 3 with bare metal programming.

- `libc`: The original (and heavily simplified) standard C library for this bare metal programming.
- `src`: Raspberry Pi 3-related codes based on [raspi3-tutorial](https://github.com/bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial).
- `doom`: Custom Doom codes based on [doomgeneric](https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric).
